Thank you for your unwavering support.
It is my honor to perform with you all.
I appreciate you letting me play as the soloist in this concerto.
Thank you for appreciating the cadenza
Thank you for your generosity.
Thank you.
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting.
Is this material for research.
So shines a good deed in a weary world... Sorry, it was just a line.
How about I play you an excerpt of Canon in return?
My fingers have been twitching ove the flute? It's... just me practicing the finger positions...
Will you stay for a little bit longer if I can explain the history of this piece here?
I've been saving the irises you sent me in a cultivation chamber so that I can plant them the next time I'm on the surface. More fitting for it to grace the earth instead of being dissected in a lecture room.
I feel nervous being so close to you... I'm afraid that you can hear the rising poundings in my M.I.N.D.
I composed a song recently. Would you like to hear it? It's still work in progress, but... I want to share it with you first.
Whenever you gift me something like this, I always seem to receive something more than just a present... There's a curious sound as well.
Hmm... Please let me know if you ever visit this region on the surface in the future. There is a flower field that I discovered by chance. Yes, only I know about it...
Can you hear it? The echoing waves in my M.I.N.D... The more I touch you, the louder it is... the more wonderful it sounds.
In scorn of nature, art gave lifeless life... All of them can come to life when instilled with emotions. Thank you for giving me such a precious life.
I have received more than enough praise.
