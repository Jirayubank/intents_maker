You've done well today. You can relax and take a break now... How about a dance with me?
Can we stay like this for a little bit longer...?
Right.
Practicing too long will hurt your body. Time to take a break.
I can hear you mind singing... It's saying it's getting tired, and it needs to rest... in a quiet midsummer night's dream...
You look tired. Can I invite you to rest with me?
Let me wish you a good night. Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest come to thy heart, as that within my breast.
Sleep. I'm by your side. May sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast...
I wonder if you'll sing something strange in your dream if you can sleep somewhere like this... I suppose it's fine that I listen in.
Can you look at me a little bit longer? Meeting your gaze has bathed me in the fountain touched by the holy fire.
