Nice to meet you. My name is Selena. If I may... have we met before?
No matter how I look, I am still me... I am still Selena.
Ah, Hello.
Conductor
You're here, Conductor, of course  I realize it's you. It's hard to mistake the unique rhythm your clothes made when you walk.
I feel like I can smell the scent of flowers when I see you... The one on my shoulder? No, that one is just an ornament.
Good morning. Umm... May I take some of your time for a sonata with me?
*Humming*... Oh, Conductor, my apologies. I was coming up with a new melody... Right, I was hoping that... you'd listen to it later.
I like this place and could willingly waste my time in it... Anywhere with you is the Forest of Arden to me.
You are everything advantageous to the iris. Will you take another look at how she blooms?
